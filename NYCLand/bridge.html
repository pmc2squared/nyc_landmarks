   <p>The Brooklyn Bridge is a hybrid cable-stayed/suspension bridge in New York City and one of the oldest roadway bridges in the United States. It connects the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn, spanning the East River. It has a main span of 1,595.5 feet and was the first steel-wire suspension bridge constructed. Originally called the New York and Brooklyn Bridge and the East River Bridge, it was later dubbed the Brooklyn Bridge, a name coming from a January 25, 1867 letter to the Brooklyn Daily Eagle editor. It was formally named by the city government in 1915. Since opening, it has become New York City icon and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964 and a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1972.</p>
      <p>Started in 1869 and completed in 1883, the bridge was conceived in 1852 by German immigrant John Augustus Roebling. He spent part of the next 15 years working to sell the idea. While conducting surveys for the project, Roebling sustained a crush injury to his foot when a ferry pinned it against a piling. After amputation of his toes, he developed a tetanus infection that left him incapacitated. Washington Roebling, his 32-year-old son, was placed in charge of the project.</p>

        <p>Three years later, shortly after ground was broken for the Brooklyn tower foundation, Washington Roebling suffered a paralyzing injury as a result of the bends. His debilitating condition left him unable to physically supervise the construction firsthand. As chief engineer, he supervised the entire project from his apartment with a view of the work, designing and redesigning caissons and other equipment. He was aided by his wife, Emily Warren Roebling, who provided the critical written link between her husband and the engineers on site. Warren Roebling studied higher mathematics, calculations of catenary curves, strengths of materials, bridge specifications, and intricacies of cable construction. She spent the 11 years helping to supervise the bridge's construction.</p>
        <p>The Brooklyn Bridge originally carried horse-drawn and rail traffic, with a separate elevated walkway along the centerline for pedestrians and bicycles. Since 1950, the main roadway has carried six lanes of automobile traffic. A $508 million project to renovate the approaches began in 2010, with the full bridge renovation beginning in early 2011. The project was completed in April 2015.</p>
